# spyrit
An anthology of programs written in Python.

# TEXT ADVENTURE
The first item in the anthology will be a text adventure written in Python (as will every other program). 
We're still figuring out the basics, and the infrastructure will likely be subject to an intense number of changes.

# A little context on the text adventure
In the beginning God created the heavens, the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. Thus to cope with this unnerving loneliness God created 13 angels in his own image. He said to them â€œBe fruitful and increase in number; watch over the earth and subdue it", and all the angels praised his glory. All angels except for one - Lucifer. God was angry at Lucifer for denying his glory and thus sentenced him to banishment from the heavens. Now the thing is Lucifer was a very smart cookie, and thus we the power of some spirits (and some spirits if you know what i mean), he managed to switch bodies with the big G himself. [Sort of like a freaky friday thingo]. The day of banishment and excile came, and the angels mistook God for Lucifer and threw the big G into the depths of hell. 

And we arrive back to the present. Lucifer has been ruling over the heavens for years now and has been doing suprisingly well; and as for God, lets just say some of his more "wilder" fantasies got fufilled. 

God remembers and is looking for revenge. Help him escape the depths of Hell and you just might go to the good place.
